### Project Description
This is a  web application designed to help employers monitor employee activity and manage tasks efficiently. The platform provides separate dashboards for employers and employees with secure role-based authentication.

### The Problem statement
In remote and hybrid work environments, employers struggle to effectively monitor employee productivity and track task progress in real time. Existing solutions often lack integration between task management and activity monitoring, leading to reduced accountability and transparency.

There is a need for a unified platform that combines task assignment, performance tracking, and real-time activity monitoring in a secure and structured system.

### The Solution
The proposed solution is a  web application that integrates task management and real-time activity monitoring into a single platform.

The system provides separate dashboards for employers and employees, enabling secure role-based access. Employers can assign tasks, monitor work activity through real-time alerts, and evaluate employee performance using productivity metrics. Employees can view assigned tasks, update progress, and track their performance transparently.

By combining monitoring, task tracking, and performance evaluation in one system, the platform improves productivity, accountability, and workflow efficiency within organizations.
